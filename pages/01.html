    <h1> Bangladesh is our Motherland </h1>  

    <h2> Bangladesh is a vibrant country located in South Asia, bordered by India to the west, north, and east, Myanmar to the southeast, and the Bay of Bengal to the south. It has a rich cultural heritage, with influences from various religions, languages, and traditions. </h2>

<!---Paragraphs-->
  
<p> Bangladesh gained independence from Pakistan in 1971 after a brutal war of liberation. Its history is marked by ancient kingdoms, colonial rule, and significant social movements. <br>

Bengali (Bangla) is the official language, spoken by the vast majority of the population. It has a rich literary tradition, with notable figures like Rabindranath Tagore and Kazi Nazrul Islam. <br> 

Bangladesh has experienced significant economic growth in recent years, largely driven by the textile and garment industry. Agriculture also plays a crucial role in the economy <br> 

The country is characterized by its vast river systems, including the Ganges, Brahmaputra, and Meghna rivers. This geography contributes to both fertile land and challenges like flooding. <br> 

Bangladesh faces challenges such as poverty, political instability, and environmental issues, including climate change impacts like rising sea levels.<br>

Bangladesh is divided into eight administrative divisions,[94][62][95] each named after their respective divisional headquarters: Barisal (officially Barishal[96]), Chittagong (officially Chattogram[96]), Dhaka, Khulna, Mymensingh, Rajshahi, Rangpur, and Sylhet.<br> 

Divisions are subdivided into districts (zila). There are 64 districts in Bangladesh, each further subdivided into upazila (subdistricts) or thana. The area within each police station, except for those in metropolitan areas, is divided into several unions, with each union consisting of multiple villages. In the metropolitan areas, police stations are divided into wards, further divided into mahallas.<br> 

There are no elected officials at the divisional or district levels, and the administration is composed only of government officials. Direct elections are held in each union (or ward) for a chairperson and several members. In 1997, a parliamentary act was passed to reserve three seats (out of 12) in every union for female candidate.<br> <br>
