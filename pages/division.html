    <h1> Divisions of Bangladesh </h1>  
    <h2>Divisions are the first-level administrative divisions in Bangladesh. </h2>
    <h3>As of 2024 there are eight divisions of Bangladesh, each named after the major city within its jurisdiction that also serves as the administrative seat of that division. </h3>
    <H4>Each division is divided into several districts which are further subdivided into upazilas(sub-districts), then union councils. </H4>

    <header>History</header>
    <!---Paragraphs-->
<p>Following the independence of Bangladesh in 1971, the country had four divisions: Chittagong Division, Dacca Division, Khulna Division, and Rajshahi Division. In 1982, the English spelling of the Dacca Division (along with the name of the capital city) was changed into Dhaka Division to more closely match the Bengali pronunciation</p>
 
<p>In 1993, Barisal Division was split off from Khulna Division, and in 1995, Sylhet Division was split off from Chittagong Division. On 25 January 2010, Rangpur Division was split off from Rajshahi Division.[1] On 14 September 2015, Mymensingh Division was split off from Dhaka Division and added as the eighth division. In 2015, the process started to create two more divisions: Comilla Division and Faridpur Division.[2] In October 2021, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina announced the formation of two new divisions, Meghna and Padma, named after the eponymous rivers,[3] in the places of Comilla and Faridpur Divisions.  </p>
